Here is a side project I'm working on for fun.  I've inherited my Aunt's genealogy work.  She spent years and years collecting and researching our family history as one of her hobbies.  Now that is passed on to me to continue, I'm hoping to provide an interactive experience for as much of that data as possible.  So, of course, I'm building my own layered graph interactive data visualization.  Somewhat reminiscent of Vertigo's Family Show (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family.Show).  A company I once had the pleasure of working at.  My data viz app is, so far, pan and zoom enabled.  Edges (person nodes) are aligned via their birth date to a scalable date axis.  The design is still primitive and while the project is in an early stage, this big piece of my app is progressing nicely.  To enable cross platform access for my extended family, I've decided to use Avalonia UI.  This does work in a browser, which is amazing!  However, I'm mainly focusing on Linux, MacOS, and Windows desktops.  Put this in the category of amazing things you can accomplish with #dotnet and #avaloniaui.
